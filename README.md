### About

This repository contains code for a proof of concept localization method
that uses structural cues in a man-made environment (warehouses for our case) and generates
state estimates that are drift free in a local sense. <br/>

We call this method
**ELSIA**  which is short for **E**xploitative **L**ocalization using **S**tructure inside **A**isles.
